# Overview
![Block Diagram](./UI_Software_Block_Diagram.svg)

The User Interface uses a touchscreen interfaced by Raspian/Linux drivers (the screen uses HDMI, the touch function uses USB).

The components in the diagram are:
* Boomer base: controls the ball throwing motors and performs ball tracking.  A real-time program written in C
* Web server: serves HTML pages including javascript and css files.  It uses [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_\(web_framework\)) to serve the pages.  The framework and pages served is written in Python.  The web-server also uses [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to send scoring updates to the browser and receive events, like level changes, from the browser.
* The Chromium browser that comes pre-installed with Raspbian.  It is launched on startup and configured to run full-screen so that browser controls (address bar, back button, refresh) are not visible.
   * Refer to after_boot.sh in the boomer_supporting_files for how Chromium is launched on startup

A mouse and keyboard will not be available - the only input will be the touchscreen.  This is significant for the following reasons:
* numeric entry is not simple - a touchscreen style keypad would have to be implemented.  Hence numeric controls (like tennis skill level) should use +/- buttons instead of number input
* browser features like hover (tool tips) and focus are not available

# Installation Instructions

For development using VS Code, install the Microsoft Python Extension in order to run under VScode control.

git clone https://github.com/davidcjordan/ui-webserver

Currently another repository has to be cloned: https://github.com/davidcjordan/control_ipc_utils 

should be cloned to /home/pi/repos.  web-ctrl.py uses python scripts in this repository to send messages to the base in order to set/get information.

NEW (using gunicorn within a virtual environment) - THIS IS DONE by after_boot.sh (boomer_supporting_files
```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install gunicorn==20.1.0 eventlet==0.30.2
python3 -m pip install flask
python3 -m pip install flask-socketio <-appears to be included with flask
```

OLD (using waitress):
```
python3 -m pip install flask-socketio
python3 -m pip install eventlet
python3 -m pip install waitress
```
jquery.js is already installed on Raspbian, but a symbolic link needs to be made.  Run the following script which is the app directory.
```
./make_links.sh
```

For more info:  https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html

The socket.io client needs to be installed in order to run not connected to the net.
For development, I used:
`<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.0.1/socket.io.js" integrity="sha512-q/dWJ3kcmjBLU4Qc47E4A9kTB4m3wuTY7vkFJDTZKjTs8jhyGQnaUrxa0Ytd0ssMZhbNua9hE+E7Qv1j+DyZwA==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
`

Couldn't get the following to work, so instead installed socket.io client using npm and copied to repository
   `<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>`
So now it's:
   `<script src="/static/js/socket.io.js"></script>`
 
To install the client, the following was done:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
cd ~/repos/ui-webserver/app/static/js
cp /home/pi/node_modules/socket.io-client/dist/socket.io.js .
cp /home/pi/node_modules/socket.io-client/dist/socket.io.js.map .
```


# Other dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/davidcjordan/drills to ~/boomer should have already been performed. The file *ui_drill_selection_lists.py* in the drills directory is used by the UI to present a subset of drills to select.

# Implementation notes:

## Starting the web server using gunicorn:
Use the following to start it from shell:
```
gunicorn  --config gunicorn.conf.py --log-config gunicorn_log.conf "app:create_app()"
```
Use the following to start it using systemd: ~/.config/systemd/user/base_gui.service
```
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'PATH=/home/pi/repos/ui-webserver/venv/bin:$PATH exec gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py --log-config gunicorn_log.conf "app:create_app()"'
```

## Templates
The base template has a section for page specific javascripts & css, as well as js required on all pages (socketio and state_update).  The base template is inherited on all other pages/templates.

## Flow
###
* Main (POST)-> drill_select_type (POST with form)-> select (POST on start button) -> drill
* Main (POST-with-mode=workout)-> select
* Main (POST)-> game_options

## New way of Drill selection
There are 3 pages, and maybe 4 in the future:
* Recents: a persisted list of 10 or so drills the user has used recently.  Persisted in this_boomers_data/recents.json  Pre-populated with drills commonly used when Boomer is first installed.
* Select: uses radio buttons to select between line drills and drill categories (practice objective, stroke type, level)
* Beep: has radio buttons to determine which drill to use
* Custom: select DRL4xx.csv to edit where the drill CSV files are stored in this_boomers_data

### Displaying drill information
A 'div' will be created at the top of the drill selection page (uses the choice_inputs template).  The div will be populated by javascript when the user clicks on a drill.  On click, the page will use socketio to emit a 'drill_info' request and get a response with a drill description generated by the python web server.  The server will read the drill file to generate the description, using description part of the drill and analyzing the drill file (number of balls, duration, whether level controls are available, e.g. all custom balls).

## Old way of Drill selection 
Refer to [Drill Categorization and Filtering](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0n3HToN0-XzfUT8dVTWYwKsZZYaLfdsvD9uuKcMHIQ)

### Lists of Drills/Workflows
Without filtering a drill list is as follows:
```
drill_list_test = [\
   {'id': '100', 'name': 'Test 100'},\
   {'id': '800', 'name': 'Test servoing'},\
...]
```

## Drill Editing
Since the touchpad keyboard is not easy to use, the drill titles are 'Custom Drill N', where you can have up to 10 custom drills.

There is one custom drill to start with.  More custom drills can be created by clicking the 'duplicate' icon.

Since the ROTTYPE enum was so long, I separated it into 2 fields: "Court" and "Angle" in order to make the drop-down menu shorter.

There are icons for adding a row and deleting the last row.  Currently there is no dialog asking which row to delete.

The numeric inputs, like Delay, are drop-down instead of number picker.  This was easier to implement and more consistent with the editting view. I selected the delays available. I figure nobody will notice a granularity of 100 milliseconds in the delay field.


### Filters
Filters are used to reduce the number of buttons (drills or workflows) the user can select from - to shrink the list of drills from an overwhelming number.

To use filters on the select.html page, a filter list needs to be provided, e.g.
```
drill_filter_list = ['data-Type', 'data-Stroke', 'data-Difficulty']
```
The 'data-' prefix is used by the filtrify javascript to filter the items.  So the example filters are Type, Stroke and Difficulty.

Additionally, each drill in the drill list needs to have a  key 'filter_values' containing a list of values to assign for each filter, e.g.:
```
{'id': '005', 'name': 'Groundstrokes Random 20 balls', 'filter_values': ['Development', 'Ground', 'Medium']}

```
When a filter_list is provided, and the drill_list includes filter_values, the select.html buttons will have extra attribute for each filter, e.g. 
```
data-Type="Development"
```

## Disabling the context pop-up in kiosk mode
refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28222548/how-to-disable-context-menu-on-right-click-long-touch-in-a-kiosk-mode-of-chrome
```
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // disable the context memu that occurs if the screen is touched too long
    window.addEventListener("contextmenu", function(e) { e.preventDefault(); })
  </script>
```
# Locating Court Points web-page notes:

* the PNG of the right or left camera is shown in 1/4 size: 640x400
* a 64x64 pixel square shows the area that is zoomed
 * currently at 8x 


## Selecting a pixel
When the up/down buttons are pushed, the background.top is reduced or increased by 1 pixel.
Same for the left/right buttons: background.left is reduced or increased.
A cursor used to identify the selected pixels is in the center of the zoomedDiv.
So only the background.top/left need to be maintained; the cursor/selected pixels is constant relative to the top/left.
(The lens needs to be moved also... TBD)

## templates
The base template has a section for page specific javascript.  This is used on the following pages:
* select.html: whether to enable filtrify (or not); NOT include
* game and drill.html: enable pause_resume, number-picker
* choice_inputs: enable emits per radio button
